Create a generic stack class GenericStack<T> that supports the following operations:
push(T item): Adds an item to the top of the stack.
T pop(): Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
T peek(): Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
boolean isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
int size(): Returns the number of items in the stack.
Type-safe Container
Develop a type-safe container class Container<T> that can hold a single object of type T. Include methods to set and retrieve the object.
